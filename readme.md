# MYSTRAP

Me trying to make a framework for my mostly used buttons, navbars, forms, hero sections, icons style, footer, and different colors and font styles.

And improving my Sassy CSS.
So like other CSS framework, this will also require you to use mostly classes and some little bit of ids, I mean why not.
